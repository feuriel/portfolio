        <h3>Hi there! I'm Gabriel !</h3>
        <p>
          I am a <em>tech lead and team catalyst</em> who wears many hats - and
          loves every one of them. At heart, I'm a leader who believes great
          software emerges when teams feel empowered, connected, and inspired.
          My superpower is
          <em> connecting people and ideas</em> - whether that's bridging
          engineers with designers, aligning tech with business goals, or
          mentoring developers into confident leaders.
        </p>
