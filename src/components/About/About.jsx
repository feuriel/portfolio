          <h3>Hi there! I'm Gabriel !</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a tech lead and team catalyst who wears many hats - and loves
            every one of them. At heart, I'm a people-first leader who believes
            great software emerges when teams feel empowered, connected, and
            inspired. My superpower is connecting people and ideas - whether
            that's bridging engineers with designers, aligning tech with
            business goals, or mentoring developers into confident leaders.
          </p>
