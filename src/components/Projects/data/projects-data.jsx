          Modern software development relies on reusable components, but
          tracking their metadata, like ownership, maturity, accessibility,
          performance, and dependencies, can be chaotic. CXC (<b>C</b>
          ustomer e<b>X</b>perience <b>C</b>
          atalog) is a centralized hub that organizes every UI element and their
          API with detailed metadata, improving governance, efficiency, and
          scalability.

          In this project, I led end-to-end development, from initial
          architecture design to implementation. I collaborated closely with
          stakeholders to define requirements, built scalable frontend and
          backend systems, and ensured seamless integration with existing tools.
          My work enabled teams to efficiently discover, manage, and reuse
          components, reducing redundancy and accelerating development.

          What if you could see a circle without actually drawing one? In this
          playful coding adventure, I explored generative art by revealing
          circles through their diameters, no curves, just lines !

          Each run generates a unique composition turning math into mesmerizing
          art. No fancy libraries, just raw geometry and curiosity. Perfect for
          screensavers, wall art, or a nerdy reminder that complexity often
          hides in plain sight.
